### Description
This project contains the code generated by Visual Studio using the template for a new ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) project. I then let Visual Studio generate scaffolding using 'Add MVC Controller with Views, Using Entity Framework'.  Changes I made to the resultant code include:
- Created POCO classes for Item and Photo. Each Item contains its own collection of Photos. 
- Restructured the generated database code. I added UnitOfWork and Repository classes so transaction processing can more easily be implemented across multiple tables. 
- Added code to allow Admin users to create/modify items and upload photos for each item. The code creates three copies of each photo; original size, medium size, and small size.
- Implemented a Bootstrap carousel to display the uploaded photos for each item.
- Update Bootstrap, JQuery, and FontAwesome to latest versions.

The purpose of this project is to give a head-start on back-end code. You will need to design the front-end to your own requirements. Minimal styling has been done.
