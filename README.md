# ASP.NET Core MVC File Upload Starter Project
A website for uploading photos. The website resizes the photos and associates them with database items. Authorized users can create/edit/delete items and add/remove photos associated with each item.

### Environment:
- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition
- .NET Core 6.0
- Bootstrap 5.1
- SQL Server Express
- Entity Framework Core 6.01 Code First

This project contains the code generated by Visual Studio using the template for a new ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) project. Once created, let Visual Studio generate scaffolding using 'Add MVC Controller with Views, Using Entity Framework'.  Changes I made to the resultant code include:
- Created POCO classes for Item and Photo. An Item contains its own collection of Photos. 
- Restructured the generated database code. I added UnitOfWork and Repository classes so transaction processing can more easily be implemented across multiple tables. 
- Added code to allow Admin users to create/modify items and upload photos for each item. The code creates three copies of each photo; original size, medium size, and small size.
- Implemented a Bootstrap carousel to display the uploaded photos for each item.
- Used CDNs for Bootstrap, JQuery, and Font Awesome. CDNs make it easier to upgrade versions on these tools.

The purpose of this project is to give a head-start on back-end code. You will need to design the front-end to your own requirements. Minimal styling has been done.
